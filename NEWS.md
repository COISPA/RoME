0. RDBFIS III Fixes 
1. check_weight() now logs detailed records of species with mean weights outside reference ranges into a CSV file instead of writing extensive messages in the .dat log, ensuring clearer logs and easier downstream analysis. Plots are now saved exclusively to files and are no longer displayed interactively, and species plots are limited to those with at least 5 observations to reduce unnecessary graph generation. The function was adapted to work with the updated DataTargetSpecies table

2. check_length() now saves all detailed inconsistencies into a CSV file instead of writing verbose messages in the .dat log, improving clarity and data traceability, using the new updated DataTargetSpecies table.

3. check_individual_weightTC changed to save the table for the comparison between the estimated  vs observed weights in TC.

4. the check_smallest_mature function was adapted to work with the updated DataTargetSpecies table

5. check_smallest_mature: Improved handling of non-numeric values in Maturity_parameters and introduced a 10% buffer when checking lengths. Added a CSV output listing all records where mature individuals are smaller than reference sizes, including the threshold size and bibliographic references. The function has also been adapted to the new format of DataTargetSpecies.

6. check_species_TBTC function improved with more robust data filtering checks, introduction of a new CSV output file for clearer results tracking, and streamlined log file content to reduce verbosity. The function has also been adapted to the new format of DataTargetSpecies.

7. check_spawning_period now logs all maturity-stage consistency warnings into a dedicated CSV file rather than filling the .dat log with verbose messages, improving traceability and downstream analyses. The function robustly handles missing (NA) values in both maturity parameters and survey data to avoid false positives. It now separates warnings for immature individuals observed within the spawning period but above size thresholds, and for mature individuals found outside the spawning period, distinguishing whether they fall below bibliographic size limits. CSV outputs include comprehensive details such as spawning months, size thresholds, and the type of inconsistency detected. The function has been adapted to work with the updated DataTargetSpecies table.

8. check_dictionary() now reports the actual invalid value in every log entry. Previously it said "value not allowed for X"; now each line includes the offending string or NA (e.g., "Haul 109: value 'XYZ' not allowed for COURSE in TA"), and messages are batched into a single writeLines() call to eliminate hundreds of small I/O operations. The function was dramatically rebuilt to optimize computational time, achieving a runtime reduction of >90% for this routine (e.g., from 12.91 s down to 0.07 s).

9. check_length(): the internal per-row loop has been replaced with vectorized index computations (which() + match()), and all I/O is consolidated into single write.table() and write() calls. These changes preserve the original logic and output formats (including handling of missing, negative, and out-of-range classes with the updated DataTargetSpecies), while delivering a â‰ˆ66% reduction in the routine's execution time (e.g., from 2.77 s down to 0.93 s).

10. Replaced all class(...) == checks with inherits(...) to improve code robustness and avoid R CMD check notes. Fixed documentation mismatchs, ensuring consistency between code default arguments and Rd files. Corrected a misplaced brace in the Rd documentation of check_position_in_Med(), resolving a note from R CMD check.
