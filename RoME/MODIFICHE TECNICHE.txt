1. Eliminare tutti i window e sostituire con dev.new() FATTO
2.Please use file.path in future, and never use \ as a file separator in an R package.
3. Please make sure that you do not change the user's options (also par).
If you really have to do so, please ensure with an *immediate* call of on.exit() that the settings are reset f.i.: oldpar <- par(asdf)
      on.exit(par(oldpar))
4. You write information messages to the console that cannot be easily suppressed. It is more R like to generate objects that can be used to
extract the information a user is interested in, and then print() that object. Instead of print()/cat() rather use message()/warning()  or
if(verbose)cat(..) if you really have to write text to the console. (da verificare in RoME.r!!!!!)
